# Webshop

This is a simple Webshop using JavaScript, html, css.

The theme is COVID-19, the language is hungarian.

Features:

          -Cart (add to cart, delete, buy, rewrite the quantity you want to buy, using localStorage,)

          -Item list (if the list is empty, it fills up with 10 premade items, otherwise it's loaded from localStorage,
            you can delete items as well, and put items into a cart)
            
          -Search bar (you can search for items by their name only)
          
          -Item upload (you can upload your own items, with these properties: name, quantity, itemID, price, description,
           and an automatically generated id using currentTime, you can also delete the localStorage from that page)
           
          -on kapcsolat.html, you can listen to Győrfi Pál's speech :D

The products have placeholder images, except for some with keywords, like "wc papír".  

The webshop doesn't have login feature, so you're kind of like an admin and a user at the same time.
